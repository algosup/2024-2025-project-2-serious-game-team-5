# 1. - Introduction

## 1.1 - Overview

The aim of this project is to create a **Serious Game** about **Climate Change**. The game will be designed to raise awareness about climate change and its consequences. The player will have to complete various missions to save the planet from the effects of climate change.

#### What is **Climate Change**?
A **Serious Game** is a game designed for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment. The "serious" adjective is generally prepended to refer to video games used by industries like defense, education, scientific exploration, health care, emergency management, city planning, engineering, religion, and politics.

#### What is **Climate Change**?
**Climate Change** is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth's local, regional, and global climates. It is caused by the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which trap heat. This leads to a rise in the Earth's temperature, which causes the melting of ice caps, the rise of sea levels, and the increase of extreme weather events.

## 1.2 - Project Definition

### 1.2.1 - Purpose

[_(Back to top)_](#toc)

Our game will use the Time Travel concept to show the player the consequences of climate change in the past and the present. The player will have to complete various missions to save the planet from the effects of climate change.
The main character is a teenager who will have to complete missions in the past to improve the qulity of life in the present. He will be guided by a crazy scientist who will guide him to complete his missions.
The present will be a post-apocalyptic world where the player will have to complete missions in the pasr to save the planet from the effects of climate change.

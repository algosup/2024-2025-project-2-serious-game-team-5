## 6. Implementation

### 6.1 Player Interaction and Camera Control

  The `Player.gd` script extends `Node3D` and handles player interactions, camera movement, and camera zoom. Below is an explanation of the key components and functions in the script.

#### Variables and Constants

```gdscript
extends Node3D

  

var mouse_sensitivity := 0.05

var moving_camera_input := Vector3()

var zoom_speed := 10

var mouse = Vector2()

var last_hovered_building = null

const distance = 1000

@onready var player_camera = $Camera3D
```

- `mouse_sensitivity`: Controls the sensitivity of the mouse for camera movement.
- `moving_camera_input`: Stores the input for moving the camera.
- `zoom_speed`: Controls the speed of the camera zoom.
- `mouse`: Stores the current mouse position.
- `last_hovered_building`: Keeps track of the last building the player hovered over.
- `distance`: The maximum distance for raycasting to detect buildings.
- `player_camera`: References the camera node in the scene.

#### Ready Function
```gdscript
func _ready() -> void:

    # Says that the cursor will be confined in the window

    Input.set_mouse_mode(Input.MOUSE_MODE_CONFINED)
``` 
- The `_ready` function confines the mouse cursor within the game window.

#### Process Function
```gdscript
func _process(_delta: float) -> void:
    # Allow the player to press 'escape' to exit the window
    if Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_cancel"):
        Input.set_mouse_mode(Input.MOUSE_MODE_VISIBLE)
        
    if Input.is_action_pressed("moving_camera"):
        translate(moving_camera_input)
```

- The `_process` function allows the player to press 'escape' to make the mouse cursor visible.
- It also translates the camera based on the `moving_camera_input`.

#### Unhandled Input Function
```gdscript
func _unhandled_input(event: InputEvent) -> void:
    # Camera movement while holding right mouse button
    if event is InputEventMouseMotion:
        if Input.is_action_pressed("moving_camera") and Input.get_mouse_mode() == Input.MOUSE_MODE_CONFINED:
            moving_camera_input.x = -event.screen_relative.x * mouse_sensitivity
            moving_camera_input.z = -event.screen_relative.y * mouse_sensitivity
    
    # Camera zoom-in (wheel down) and zoom-out (wheel up)
    if event is InputEventMouseButton:
        if Input.is_action_pressed("zoom_camera_in"):
            player_camera.size = clamp(player_camera.size - zoom_speed, 30.0, 150.0)
        elif Input.is_action_pressed("zoom_camera_out"):
            player_camera.size = clamp(player_camera.size + zoom_speed, 30.0, 150.0)
```
- The `_unhandled_input` function handles camera movement when the right mouse button is held down.
- It also handles camera zoom-in and zoom-out using the mouse wheel.

#### Input Function
```gdscript
func _input(event):
    if event is InputEventMouseMotion:
        mouse = event.position
    if event is InputEventMouseButton:
        if Input.is_action_pressed("interact"):
            _get_mouse_pos(mouse)
```
- The `_input` function updates the mouse position and handles interactions when the left mouse button is clicked.

#### Get Mouse Position Function

```gdscript
func _get_mouse_pos(mouse: Vector2):
    var space = get_world_3d().direct_space_state
    var start = get_viewport().get_camera_3d().project_ray_origin(mouse)
    var end = get_viewport().get_camera_3d().project_position(mouse, distance)
    var params = PhysicsRayQueryParameters3D.new()
    params.from = start
    params.to = end
    var result = space.intersect_ray(params)
    
    # Call the _hover_visible & _hover_hidden functions of Building.gd & Building_2.gd
    if result and result.collider.has_method("_hover_visible"):
        # Will hide the hover of the last hovered building
        if last_hovered_building and last_hovered_building != result.collider:
            last_hovered_building.call("_hover_hidden")
        # It will show the hover of the currently clicked building
        result.collider.call("_hover_visible")
        # Update the last hovered building
        last_hovered_building = result.collider
    else:
        # If no collision is detected it will call _hover_hidden on all Building instances
        for building in get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("buildings"):
            if building.has_method("_hover_hidden"):
                building.call("_hover_hidden")
        # Will hide the hover effect for every buildings in "buildings" group
        last_hovered_building = null
```

- The `_get_mouse_pos` function determines which building is clicked by the player using raycasting.
- It calls the `_hover_visible` and `_hover_hidden` functions on the buildings to show or hide hover effects.

### 6.2 Main Control and User Interface

The `MainControl.gd` script extends `Control` and handles the main menu interactions, user data, and settings management. Below is an explanation of the key components and functions in the script.

#### Variables

```gdscript
extends Control

var userDataFile = FileAccess.file_exists("user://userLanguage.dat")
var userSettingsFile = FileAccess.file_exists("user://settings.json")
```
- `userDataFile`: Checks if the user language data file exists.
- `userSettingsFile`: Checks if the user settings file exists.

#### Ready Function
```gdscript
func _ready():

    _gameInit()

    $PlayButton.connect("pressed", self._onPressed.bind(1))

    $LeaveButton.connect("pressed", self._onPressed.bind(2))

    $SettingsButton.connect("pressed", self._onPressed.bind(3))

    $CreditsButton.connect("pressed", self._onPressed.bind(4))
```
- The `_ready` function initializes the game and connects button presses to the `_onPressed` function.

#### Game Initialization
```gdscipt
func _gameInit():
    var language
    # Check if user data file exist
    if userDataFile:
        language = _loadUserData()
    else:
        _createUserData()
        language = _loadUserData()
    
    # Check if settings file exist
    if userSettingsFile:
        return
    else:
        _createUserSettings()
        
    # Setup the text language
    match language:
        "english":
            $PlayButton.text = "Play"
            $LeaveButton.text = "Leave the game"
            $SettingsButton.text = "Settings"
            $CreditsButton.text = "Credits"
            $WelcomeText.text = "Welcome to Brought Back City"
        "french":
            $PlayButton.text = "Jouer"
            $LeaveButton.text = "Quitter le jeu"
            $SettingsButton.text = "Paramètres"
            $CreditsButton.text = "Crédits"
            $WelcomeText.text = "Bienvenue sur Brought Back City"
```

- The `_gameInit` function initializes the game settings and user data.
- It checks if the user data and settings files exist and creates them if they do not.
- It sets up the text language for the UI elements based on the user's language preference.

#### Button Press Handling
``
```gdscript
func _onPressed(i):
    match i:
        1: # Starting the game function
            get_tree().change_scene_to_file("res://Scenes/World.tscn")
        2: # Exiting the game function
            get_tree().quit() 
        3: # Switch to Settings menu
            get_tree().change_scene_to_file("res://Scenes/SettingsMenu.tscn")
        4: # Switch to Credits
            get_tree().change_scene_to_file("res://Scenes/Credits.tscn")

```

- The `_onPressed` function handles button presses and performs different actions based on the button pressed.
- It changes the scene to the game world, settings menu, or credits, or exits the game.

#### Load User Data

```gdscript
func _loadUserData():

    var file = FileAccess.open("user://userLanguage.dat", FileAccess.READ)

    var content = file.get_as_text()

    return content
```
- The `_loadUserData` function loads the user's language preference from the `userLanguage.dat` file.

#### Create User Data
```gdscript
func _createUserData():

    var file = FileAccess.open("user://userLanguage.dat", FileAccess.WRITE)

    file.store_string("english")
```
The `_createUserData` function creates a default `userLanguage.dat` file with English as the default language

#### Create User Settings
```gdscript
func _createUserSettings():

    var file = FileAccess.open("user://settings.json", FileAccess.WRITE)

    var default_settings = {

        "right": "D",

        "left": "A",

        "forward": "W",

        "backward": "S"

    }

    file.store_string(JSON.stringify(default_settings))

    print("File created successfully")

    file.close()
```
- The `_createUserSettings` function creates a default `settings.json` file with default key bindings for movement.

### 6.7 Building Interaction

  

The `Building.gd` script extends `StaticBody3D` and handles the hover effects for buildings in the game. Below is an explanation of the key components and functions in the script.

  

#### Variables

  

```gdscript

extends StaticBody3D

  

@onready var hidden_hover = $BuildingMesh/BuildingHover
```
- `hidden_hover`: A reference to the hover effect node within the building mesh.

#### Ready Function
```gdscript
func _ready() -> void:
    add_to_group("buildings")
```



- The `_ready` function adds the building instance to the "buildings" group. This allows the game to manage and interact with all buildings collectively.
#### Hover Visible Function
```gdscript
func _hover_visible():
    hidden_hover.visible = true
```
- The `_hover_visible` function makes the hover effect visible when the building is hovered over by the player.

#### Hover Hidden Function
```gdscript
func _hover_hidden():

    hidden_hover.visible = false

- The `_hover_hidden` function hides the hover effect when the building is no longer hovered over by the player.
```

## **5. Next Steps**  
- **Upcoming Milestone**: Kickoff Development & Testing (November 18–December 6, 2024).  
- **Planned Tasks**:  
  - Finalize Technical Specification and GDD.  
  - Start developing "Menu v0.1" and the first core mechanics.  
  - Begin QA setup for prototype playtesting.  
- **Deadlines**: November 18, 2024.

## **6. Notes and Updates**  
- The updated Gantt diagram shifted to account for delays in GDD and Technical Specification.  
- Task dependencies for the prototype are now tightly scheduled to avoid cascading delays.  
- The team remains motivated despite the challenges, and adjustments were made to keep the timeline realistic.

---

## **7. Team Feedback**  
- **Team Notes**:  
  - Concerns raised about frequent changes to initial tasks, particularly GDD.  
  - Suggested more consistent review points for large deliverables to avoid late revisions.  

- **Improvements for Next Week**:  
  - Increase team alignment meetings to address blockers early.  
  - Clearly define revised project goals to stabilize the GDD and development phase.

## **1. Overview**  
- **Current Week Milestone**: Development Kickoff  
- **Progress Summary**:  
  - Major project realignment due to scope concerns.  
  - The Game Design Document (GDD) was revised to focus on a simplified scope.  
  - Technical Specification and Functional Specification were adjusted to align with new priorities.  
  - Development officially kicked off, starting with **Prototype Menu v0.1** and key mechanics.

## **4. Challenges and Risks**  

| **Challenge/Risk**                    | **Impact**           | **Resolution Plan**                      | **Status**       |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------|
| Project scope was too broad           | High                | Reduced features to core mechanics only.| Resolved         |
| Tight timeline for new deliverables   | High                | Prioritized prototype work immediately. | In Progress      |
| Team adapting to realignment          | Medium              | Regular team syncs to align on changes. | In Progress      |

## **5. Next Steps**  
- **Upcoming Milestone**: Prototype Development (November 25–December 6, 2024).  
- **Planned Tasks**:  
  - Finalize **Menu v0.1** screens and first core mechanics.  
  - Begin early internal testing on UI and game flow.  
  - QA team to prepare testing scenarios for simplified scope.  
- **Deadlines**: November 29, 2024.  

---

## **6. Notes and Updates**  
- The team agreed that the previous scope was unmanageable given the timeline.  
- The revised plan focuses on delivering a functional prototype with polished core mechanics, leaving secondary features for future iterations.  
- Stakeholders have been informed and have approved the changes.  

---

## **7. Team Feedback**  
- **Team Notes**:  
  - Positive response to scope realignment: clearer tasks and achievable milestones.  
  - Concerns about tight deadlines for the prototype phase.  

- **Improvements for Next Week**:  
  - Monitor task progress daily to avoid further delays.  
  - Improve communication flow to prevent misunderstandings about the revised scope.

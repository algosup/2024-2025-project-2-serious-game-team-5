## **1. Risk Identification**

### **a. Schedule Risks**
- **Risk**: Delays in meeting milestones (e.g., GDD completion, prototype development).  
  - **Likelihood**: Medium  
  - **Impact**: High  
  - **Trigger**: Miscommunication, unrealistic workload distribution.

### **b. Technical Risks**
- **Risk**: Difficulty in implementing game mechanics or integrating climate data into gameplay.  
  - **Likelihood**: Medium  
  - **Impact**: High  
  - **Trigger**: Lack of familiarity with tools (e.g., Godot) or unexpected bugs.  

### **c. Team Risks**
- **Risk**: Team member unavailability (sickness, personal reasons).  
  - **Likelihood**: Medium  
  - **Impact**: High  
  - **Trigger**: Over-reliance on specific members.  

### **d. Resource Risks**
- **Risk**: Insufficient resources (hardware, software licenses).  
  - **Likelihood**: Low  
  - **Impact**: Medium  
  - **Trigger**: Budget mismanagement or delayed procurement.  

### **e. Quality Risks**
- **Risk**: Final product does not meet quality expectations.  
  - **Likelihood**: Medium  
  - **Impact**: High  
  - **Trigger**: Inadequate testing or rushed development.

## **2. Risk Assessment**

| **Risk**                  | **Likelihood** | **Impact** | **Priority** |
|---------------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| Delays in milestones      | Medium         | High       | High         |
| Technical implementation  | Medium         | High       | High         |
| Team unavailability       | Medium         | High       | High         |
| Insufficient resources    | Low            | Medium     | Medium       |
| Product quality issues    | Medium         | High       | High         |

## **3. Risk Mitigation Plan**

### **a. Schedule Risks**  
- Implement weekly sprint reviews to monitor progress.  
- Break milestones into smaller, manageable tasks.  
- Create contingency plans for milestone delays.  

### **b. Technical Risks**  
- Conduct a technology workshop to familiarize the team with Godot.  
- Allocate time for debugging and peer code reviews.  
- Consult online resources or seek mentorship for challenging features.

### **c. Team Risks**  
- Cross-train team members to reduce reliance on specific individuals.  
- Maintain a shared task tracker to redistribute tasks if necessary.  
- Encourage open communication about availability.  

### **d. Resource Risks**  
- Confirm resource availability before project kickoff.  
- Keep a buffer budget for unforeseen expenses.  
- Use open-source alternatives when possible.  

### **e. Quality Risks**  
- Allocate time for iterative testing during playtesting weeks.  
- Use feedback from prototype playtesting to refine mechanics.  
- Perform final quality assurance before release.

## **4. Risk Monitoring and Control**

- Use a **Risk Log** to record, monitor, and update risks weekly.  
- Assign a **Risk Manager** to oversee risk assessments and mitigation.  
- Review risk status in weekly team meetings.  

**Risk Log Template**:  

| **Date**       | **Risk Identified**       | **Action Taken**         | **Status**       |  
|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|  
| [MM/DD/YYYY]    | [Description of Risk]     | [Mitigation Steps]       | [Open/Resolved]  |

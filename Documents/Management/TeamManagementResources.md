## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

To monitor project success, the following KPIs have been defined.

### Document Progress

Progress of key documents is calculated using:  

Completion Rate (%) = (Completed Sections / Total Sections) × 100

Tracked documents include:  
1. Game Design Document (GDD)  
2. Functional Specification  
3. Technical Specifications  
4. User Manual  

---

### Development Milestones

The technical progress is tracked across core elements, with overall progress measured as:

Progress (%) = (Sum of Progress for Core Elements / Total Core Elements) × 100

Core elements include:  
- Interface Design  
- Game Logic  
- Prototype Development  

---

### Team Well-being

The team’s motivation and engagement will be assessed weekly using anonymous feedback surveys:

Mood Score (%) = (Sum of Ratings / Maximum Possible Score) × 100

This ensures we address team concerns and maintain productivity.

## Risk Management Plan

Risks are identified, assessed for likelihood and impact, and mitigated through clear strategies.

| **Risk/Issue**                                                                 | **Impact**    | **Mitigation Strategy**                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Difficulty balancing educational content with engaging gameplay.               | High         | Iterate gameplay mechanics based on user testing feedback.    |
| Challenges in accurately simulating climate-related scenarios for audiences.   | Medium       | Consult climate experts and use realistic models.             |
